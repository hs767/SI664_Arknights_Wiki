# SI664_Arknights_Wiki

The tar.gz file is the zip of the whole project.

The aw folder contains all codes of the project.

The project has 5 OneToMany Fields, and 2 ManyToMany Fields. Originally, I planned implement rating as an OneToMany Field, but later I figured that it might be better to combine it with the comment field, and thus ended up with 5 OneToMany Fields and 2 ManyToMany Fields.

Including the tables used to save ManyToMany field data, there are 6 models(tables).
